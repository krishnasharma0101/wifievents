      "content": "Need ratio of dissociation to association counts. From sample 10 rows: associations at indices 993,298,553,672,306 (5). disassociations at 859,231,706 (3). Ratio 3/5=0.6. Provide insights etc.## Insights\n- **Association events**: 5 distinct records in the sample.\n- **Disassociation events**: 3 distinct records in the sample.\n- **Ratio (disassociations ÷ associations)**:  \n  \\[\n  \\frac{3}{5} = 0.60\n  \\]\n  So, for every 10 association attempts there are roughly 6 disassociation occurrences.\n\n## Possible Reasons\n1. **Weak signal or interference** – many association attempts may be quickly dropped due to low RSSI values (e.g., `rssi: 11`).\n2. **Authentication failures** – the client may be repeatedly authenticating but then being deauthenticated (`client was deauthenticated`, `previous authentication expired`).\n3. **Client device behavior** – Android devices sometimes disconnect when switching networks or due to power‑saving modes.\n4. **AP configuration limits** – the access point could have a timeout or max client limit that triggers disassociations.\n\n## Suggested Actions\n1. **Check signal strength trends** for all clients; consider moving APs or adjusting channels if RSSI is consistently low.\n2. **Review authentication logs** to see if failures precede disassociations, and verify EAP/PSK settings on the AP.\n3. **Inspect AP firmware/configuration** for timeout values or client limits that may be too aggressive.\n4. **Collect more data over a longer period** to confirm whether this ratio is stable or fluctuates with time of day or traffic load.\n\n## Follow‑up Questions\n1. What are the total counts of association and disassociation events across the entire dataset (not just the 10 rows)?\n2. Do the disassociations cluster around specific times of day or particular APs?\n3. Are there any patterns in the `Details` field that indicate a common reason for disconnecting (e.g., “unspecified reason” vs. “client was deauthenticated”)?\n4. What are the average RSSI values for associations versus disassociations?\n5. How many unique clients appear only once versus multiple times, and does repeat behavior correlate with higher disassociation rates?\n6. Are there any firmware or configuration changes made to the APs during this period that might influence stability?\n7. Does the network use WPA2/WPA3 or 802.1X authentication, and could mismatched settings be causing deauthentications?"
